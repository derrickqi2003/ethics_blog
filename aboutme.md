### Our Mission

We are Open Ethics. Our mission is to provide an open forum for people to discuss the ethical issues surrouding the creation of medical technologies. Feel free to read our articles and post your opinions about the ethical dilemmas. Any opinion, no matter how controversial, will always be accepted; diverse perspectives are the key to ensuring medical devices are used safely.


### How you can contribute

We are currently working on allowing other people to submit their own opinion articles for review. Articles will be accepted as long as the topic is relevant, and the opinions are well-formed. We do NOT reject articles because of the opinions described within them; Open Ethics accepts any and all opinions in order to promote open discussion.
