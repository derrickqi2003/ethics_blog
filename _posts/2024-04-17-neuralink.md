In this article, we analyze the ethical issues surrounding DNA analysis technology from a CNN article titled “Human DNA can now be pulled from thin air or a footprint on the beach. Here’s what that could mean.”

When searching for an article to discuss for the Ethics in the News assignment, I was looking for a topic that was highly controversial and almost dystopian in technology today, as such topics are filled with ethical dilemmas that lead to good discussion.

This search ultimately led me to choose an article on Neuralink titled “Elon Musk wants to merge humans with AI. How many brains will be damaged along the way?”. This article was written by Sigal Samuel, a writer for Future Perfect on Vox, which covers developments in artificial intelligence and neuroscience. Sigal earned her BA in Philosophy from McGill University, and has been featured on a variety of news sources, from traditional news networks like the BBC to more niche news outlets like The Walrus. Her experience in the intersection of technological and philosophical issues made the article fairly reputable and a good way to discuss ethical issues regarding the integration of biology and computer technology. However, Samuel is clearly skeptical of Neuralink, and so previous bias, likely towards the founder Elon Musk and his previous ventures, may have influenced the article’s perspective.

The article discusses Elon Musk’s Neuralink, which is a company that implants technology within the brains of those with paralysis so that they can complete tasks more effectively. The topicality of this article comes from the fact that Neuralink recently got FDA approval to start running trials on humans, which Samuel argues is risky, especially since she claims that Neuralink employees believe that the tests that Neuralink did on animals were highly invasive and dangerous. Samuel continues by arguing that even beyond the ethical issues raised by the dangerous tests on animals, there are more ethical issues regarding the misuse of this technology and the possible invasions of privacy that come from implanting such technology.

Personally, I really enjoyed the focus on ethical issues within the article. Particularly, I liked the fact that neuroethicist Marcello Ineca was interviewed, as it gives more reputability to the article. I also thought that the two major ethical issues discussed were interesting, as I hadn’t even considered one of them before reading this article.

For one, the article discusses the larger implications of having brain-computer interface technology, as there are clear risks to giving others access to your brain data. Initially, I was very interested in this ethical dilemma, since it reminded me of dystopian ideas of corporations or governments controlling the brains of humans, some of which were even alluded to in the article. The comparisons I made to an Orwellian dystopia definitely made me skeptical of Neuralink's use on humans, however through our discussions, I was able to see things in a different context that actually shifted my beliefs in the use of the technology. For example, many members of our discussion group compared this technology to pacemakers or prosthetic limbs, which was not the comparison I was making before having the discussion, although this comparison is very astute. The fact that this technology was made for the paralyzed also led to discussions on the ethics of denying people access to an improved quality of life. The idea of a cost-benefit analysis to whether or not the potential benefits to those who may need such technology was not something that I had considered before, especially since I was immediately

a skeptic, and so in a new context, I was able to understand why Neuralink technology may not be completely unethical. Many of our group members were actually supportive of Neuralink technology and could see a world in which they implanted Neuralink technology within themselves, and although I wasn’t fully convinced, I was definitely more understanding of how Neuralink could be beneficial.

However, the ethical dilemma that I found more interesting was the risks of the way in which Neuralink was implanted. According to the article, Musk’s technology is much more invasive than other brain-computer interfaces that serve the same purpose, and Musk defends this highly invasive technology by arguing that it offers advantages in terms of bandwidth and effectiveness of the technology. However, Ineca claims that “according to international research ethics guidelines it wouldn’t be ethical to use a more invasive technology if the same performance can be achieved using less invasive methods”. I hadn’t considered this ethical issue before, but my immediate reaction was that this technology may not be addressing major ethical concerns, likely because I was already a skeptic of the technology. Furthermore, the disastrous consequences of the animal experiments Neuralink implemented, where monkeys were forced to be put down, made me skeptical of the FDA’s decision to approve human trials. Through discussion, I was able to further understand the process by which Neuralink got approval, and although no clear consensus was reached, a variety of information was discussed which led to a more nuanced understanding of Neuralink’s ethical concerns. Particularly, the Class-III classification that Neuralink falls into means that it must go through a very rigorous regulatory process for the device to be approved for human trials.1 This eased some of my tensions regarding the fact that the technology was going to be implemented on humans, but as we further discussed the technology, many group members, along with myself, agreed that it would be best that the risks of this technology be transparent to those planning to implant it within themselves, and make sure that all parties involved are on the same page before such a drastic decision is made.

Ultimately, through these ethical discussions, I am much more conflicted on the ethical issues that Neuralink raised. Before having discussions, I was very adamant in my skepticism, but I believe that through understanding various perspectives on both the way the technology is implemented and the privacy concerns, I believe that there is a lot more to be said on this topic before I can come to a solid conclusion. I hope to have more discussions on such topics in the future to come to some solutions to these ethical issues.

Given these ethical issues, we would like to hear what you, as the reader, thinks about this ethical dilemma. Feel free to respond to these seed questions or start a new discussion on a related topic.
Seed Questions:

"What are the possible ethical issues with implanting technology that records information and data within the brain"
"What do you feel about the methodology Neuralink is taking to implant these threads within paralyzed patients? 
"Should the FDA have given Neuralink approval to do human trials?"
"Do you think that Neuralink should be used to “better” the lives of those with paralysis?"
"What are the privacy concerns of brain-computer interfaces?"
