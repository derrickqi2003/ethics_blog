In this article, we analyze the ethical issues surrounding DNA analysis technology from a NPR article titled “Experts weigh medical advances in gene-editing with ethical dilemmas.”

The recent gathering in London for the Third International Summit on Human Genome Editing has reignited discussions on the ethics of gene editing. With technologies like CRISPR gaining prominence, it's crucial to consider the ethical responsibilities of engineers and scientists through a deontological lens.

In 2018, He Jiankui's announcement of gene-edited twins shocked the world, sparking concerns over safety and consent. From a deontological perspective, certain actions are inherently wrong, regardless of their potential benefits. Altering the genetic makeup of embryos raises profound ethical questions about the sanctity of life and individual autonomy. Engineers have a moral duty to recognize the intrinsic value of life and respect the autonomy of individuals, ensuring that their actions uphold these fundamental principles.

Moreover, deontologists emphasize the importance of respecting moral duties and principles, regardless of the consequences. While gene editing holds promise for addressing genetic diseases, it also presents risks, such as the creation of "designer babies" and exacerbating societal inequalities. Engineers must navigate these ethical dilemmas with a steadfast commitment to moral duties, ensuring that their actions align with principles of justice and human dignity.

The rush to advance gene-editing technologies must be tempered by a thoughtful consideration of their ethical implications. Engineers have a duty to engage in transparent dialogue with stakeholders, including ethicists, policymakers, and the public, to ensure that their work upholds moral principles and societal values.

The case of He Jiankui serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the dangers of disregarding ethical responsibilities in scientific research. By embracing a deontological perspective, engineers can navigate the complexities of gene editing in a manner that is both scientifically rigorous and morally sound, thereby upholding the highest ethical standards and prioritizing the welfare of all individuals.

Given these ethical issues, we would like to hear what you, as the reader, thinks about this ethical dilemma. Feel free to respond to these seed questions or start a new discussion on a related topic.

Seed Questions:

"How do we balance the potential benefits of gene editing, such as eradicating genetic diseases, with the ethical concerns surrounding consent and autonomy?"
"What are the moral implications of creating "designer babies" through gene editing, and how do we address concerns about exacerbating societal inequalities?"
"Should there be limitations on the use of gene editing technology, particularly when it comes to altering the genetic makeup of future generations?"
"What ethical responsibilities do engineers and scientists have when developing and utilizing gene-editing technologies, and how can they ensure their work aligns with moral principles?"
